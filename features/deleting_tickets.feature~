Feature: Deleting tickets
  In order to remove tickets
  As a user
  I want to press a button and make them disappear
  
  Background:
    Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
    And that project has a ticket:
      | title          | description                    |
      | Make it shiny! | Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my!  |
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow Text
